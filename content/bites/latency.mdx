When we are talking about latency, we are referring to the delay between the initiation of a request or action and when it is done.
A measure of the time it takes for data to travel from point **A** to point **B** through a networking system.

Latency can happen for different reasons, for example, when sending some data from point a to point b and where point be is fare away from point b, we will have a higher latency.

Latency is often measured in milliseconds (ms) and it can have a huge impact on the performance of a system, specially in real time applications such as video streaming, gaming or financial trading.

In summary, latency is the time delay that occurs when a request or action is initiated and completed, and it is a critical performance metric in many computer science applications.
