There are a lot of utils and plugins in Tailwind, but I want to highlight some of them that I use the most.
One of my favorite util function that I use in every project I am working with is the `cn` function that helps me to conditionally add classes to my elements and
compose them together.

```ts
export function cn(...classes: ClassValue[]) {
	return twMerge(clsx(...classes));
}
```

This function is a wrapper around `clsx` and `twMerge` functions.
`clsx` is a function that helps you to conditionally add classes to your elements.
`twMerge` is a function that helps you to compose classes together. For example, if you have a class `text-red-500` and you want to add `text-sm` to it, you can use `twMerge` function to compose them together and get `text-red-500 text-sm` as a result.

```tsx
import {cn} from "utils";

export function Button({className, disabled, ...props}) {
	return (
		<button
			className={cn(
				"bg-blue-500",
				"hover:bg-blue-700",
				"text-white",
				"font-bold",
				"py-2",
				"px-4",
				"rounded",
				"focus:outline-none",
				"focus:shadow-outline",
				disabled && "opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed",
				className,
			)}
			{...props}
		/>
	);
}
```

Here is an example of how you can use `cn` function to conditionally add classes to your elements. In this example, we are using `cn` function to add `opacity-50` and `cursor-not-allowed` classes to our button if it is disabled.
This pattern is very useful when you are working with React and you want to add some classes to your elements conditionally.
