Sometimes, it's useful to check how our components behave with a little delay. Imagine testing a loading component, simulating a 3-second delay.
This is especially relevant for users on slower connections, where we want to provide a friendly indication that the page is loading.

In the world of React, we have tools like Suspense and Lazy loading that help us create smooth and efficient user interfaces.
However, when we're developing on our speedy machines, everything usually works seamlessly.

To mimic a slower connection and see how our components handle it, we can employ a straightforward solution – the sleep function.
Let's take a look at how to use it.

## Usage

```js
function sleep(ms) {
	return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function demo() {
	console.log("Taking a break...");
	await sleep(2000);
	console.log("Two seconds later");
}
```

Here, we've got a function named sleep, which needs a time parameter in milliseconds (ms). Inside this function, we create a promise. It involves a callback function with a setTimeout function, which, in turn, has another callback function with a resolve function taking the time parameter (ms).

Now, there's an async function called demo. It does a console log, then waits for 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) using the `sleep()` function, and finally logs another message to the console.

It's pretty straightforward, but for this simple scenario, it might not seem very convenient.

Let's see how we can use this in a React component with React Server Components (RSC) using NextJS.

```jsx showLineNumbers{5,16}
import {sleep} from "../utils/sleep";

async function getUsers() {
	await sleep(3000);
	return [
		{name: "John Doe", age: 30},
		{name: "Jane Doe", age: 25},
		{name: "John Smith", age: 40},
		{name: "Jane Smith", age: 35},
	];
}

// RSC component
async function Users() {
	let users = await getUsers();
	return (
		<div>
			{users.map((user) => (
				<div key={user.name}>
					<h2>{user.name}</h2>
					<p>{user.age}</p>
				</div>
			))}
		</div>
	);
}
```

In our code, there's a function called `getUsers()`. It does something cool: it waits for 3 seconds (simulating a slow connection using the sleep function) and then gives us an array of users.

Now, meet our RSC component named Users. It patiently waits for the getUsers function and then does something nice – it goes through the array of users and displays them on the screen.

We're cleverly using the sleep function to make it feel like things are loading slowly, just like they might on a sluggish internet connection.

In Next.js, when we create a file named `loading.js`, it shows users something while the actual component is loading.
Next.js is smart and takes advantage of Suspense behind the scenes, but we can also use Suspense in our own components.
But that is for another article where we could go into more detail about Suspense and Lazy loading.

### Conclusion

- The sleep function is a handy function that we can use to simulate a slow connection when we are developing our components.
- We can use the sleep function in React components to simulate a slow connection.
- Remember to remove the sleep function when you are done with your testing so that you don't slow down your application in production.
