# Toggle Hook

When React 16.8 introduced hooks, it revolutionised the way developers think and write React code. We could now easily bypass _class_ components and rely solely on function components, thanks to hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, which allowed us to accomplish tasks that were previously exclusive to class components.

One particularly appealing aspect of the hooks API is the ability to create custom hooks.

Today, I want to share a remarkably simple yet incredibly useful hook. I personally use it in my daily private projects and at work. Its simplicity combined with its practicality makes it truly elegant, in my opinion.

Allow me to present the toggle hook. While it may not be rocket science, it is still incredibly handy and applicable in numerous scenarios.

```tsx
import {useMemo, useState} from "react";

interface ToggleHandlers {
	toggle: () => void;
	setTrue: () => void;
	setFalse: () => void;
	reset: () => void;
}

type Toggle = [boolean, ToggleHandlers];

export function useToggle(initialState = false): Toggle {
	const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
	const handlers = useMemo(
		() => ({
			toggle: () => setState((prevState) => !prevState),
			setTrue: () => setState(true),
			setFalse: () => setState(false),
			reset: () => setState(initialState),
		}),
		[initialState]
	);
	return [state, handlers];
}
```

The code snippet provided defines the `useToggle` custom hook in TypeScript. This hook utilises the `useMemo` and `useState` hooks from the React library. It returns a tuple containing the current boolean state and a set of toggle handlers.

**Toggle Handlers:**
The `useToggle` hook provides four toggle handlers that allow easy manipulation of the boolean state:

1. `toggle`: Toggles the boolean state between `true` and `false`.
2. `setTrue`: Sets the boolean state to `true`.
3. `setFalse`: Sets the boolean state to `false`.
4. `reset`: Resets the boolean state to its initial value.

**Efficient State Management:**
The hook leverages `useMemo` to memoize the toggle handlers, ensuring they are recomputed only when the initial state value changes. This optimisation helps prevent unnecessary re-renders, leading to improved performance.

**Practical Applications:**
The `useToggle` hook is versatile and finds utility in various scenarios. It simplifies conditional rendering, controls visibility of components, and enables straightforward handling of boolean flags or switches. By encapsulating the state and toggle logic within the hook, it promotes clean and modular code organisation.

**Conclusion:**
The `useToggle` custom hook provides a concise and reusable solution for managing boolean states in React. With its intuitive toggle handlers and efficient state management, it empowers developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code. By incorporating this hook into your React projects, you can enhance productivity and deliver high-quality applications. Happy coding!
