The HTML anchor tag is a versatile and valuable element, offering more functionalities than just basic navigation. Let's explore three different use cases showcasing the diverse capabilities of the anchor tag.

1. **Sending POST Requests**

   The anchor tag can be used to send POST requests with specified data to a particular URL. In the example below, a POST request with the body "PING" is sent to the specified URL when the link is clicked.

   ```html
   <a href="https://www.someurl.com/html" ping="https://api.tracking.com">
   	Click Me
   </a>
   ```

2. **Downloading Files**

   You can use the anchor tag to facilitate file downloads. The condition for this functionality is that the file should be from the same origin or use the `data:` or `blob:` directive. The following example demonstrates how to create a download link for a CSV file.

   ```html
   <a href="myfile.csv" download> Download </a>
   ```

3. **Opening Email Clients**

   Anchor tags can also be employed to open email clients with pre-defined content. In the instance below, clicking the link initiates the default email client with the recipient address and a predefined subject.

   ```html
   <a href="mailto:masiuciszek@x.com?subject=Test%20mailto"> Hi ðŸ‘‹ </a>
   ```

With these anchor tag options we have the possibility to do more useful stuff by just using the web, which is awesome.
