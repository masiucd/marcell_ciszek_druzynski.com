A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called by that function at a later time. The primary purpose of a callback function is to allow the calling function to continue its execution while also allowing the called function to perform some task asynchronously and notify the calling function when it has completed.

In other words, a callback function is a way of passing a function as a parameter to another function, with the expectation that the callback function will be called at some point during the execution of the parent function. This is a common pattern in asynchronous programming, where a long-running operation is started and the callback function is used to handle the result when it becomes available.

For example, in JavaScript, a common use case for a callback function is in handling the result of an asynchronous AJAX request. The request is initiated, and the callback function is passed as a parameter. When the request completes, the callback function is executed with the result as its argument. This allows the program to continue executing other code while waiting for the AJAX request to complete.

For example:

```js
function greeting(name, callback) {
	console.log("Hello " + name);
	callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
	console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greeting("John", sayGoodbye);
```

In this example, the greeting function takes two arguments: a name and a callback function. The greeting function logs a message to the console and then calls the callback function.

The sayGoodbye function is defined separately and passed as a callback to the greeting function. When greeting is called with the name 'John' and the sayGoodbye function, it logs 'Hello John' to the console, and then calls the sayGoodbye function, which logs 'Goodbye!' to the console.

This is just a simple example, but it demonstrates the concept of a callback function being passed as an argument and executed at a later time by the calling function.
