# Dependency injection

It may sound like dependency injection is a complicated process, but it really isn't that complex.

The concept of dependency injection is simple: you pass a piece of code that uses another piece of code rather than directly referencing it in a function or class.

As an example, if we import a function from module `a`

We have created a dependency on module `b` for some other functionality from module `b`.
This is common practice in software development, and we use it every day when we write code.

```javascript
import {someFunction} from "a";

function myFunction() {
  someFunction();
}
```

We need to think a bit further since we do not want to have too many dependencies which can make refactoring harder (classes, functions).

Instead of creating the object that we need in our class, we could provide the class in the constructor, aka inject the dependency.

While the core principles are pretty simple, since a lot of frameworks and libraries use or focus mainly on dependency injection, the topic has become more complex than it should be.

Dependency injection is loved by some developers, but avoided by others.

Dependency injection comes from a design principle called [_Inversion of control_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).

Using this pattern, you can make your code more reusable by accepting custom input that can be deferred to perform some logic, steps, etc.

For example,

```javascript
// Traditional approach without IoC

function traditionalSort(arr) {
  return arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}

// IoC approach

function iocSort(arr, compareFn) {
  return arr.sort(compareFn);
}

// Usage

let numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5];

// Traditional approach

console.log("Traditional sort:", traditionalSort(numbers));

// IoC approach

console.log(
  "Ascending sort:",
  iocSort(numbers, (a, b) => a - b),
);

console.log(
  "Descending sort:",
  iocSort(numbers, (a, b) => b - a),
);

// IoC with custom comparison

const people = [
  {name: "Alice", age: 30},

  {name: "Bob", age: 25},

  {name: "Charlie", age: 35},
];

console.log(
  "Sort by age:",
  iocSort(people, (a, b) => a.age - b.age),
);

console.log(
  "Sort by name:",
  iocSort(people, (a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name)),
);
```

We demonstrate **IoC** using a sorting function in this example:

1. The `traditionalSort` function is a typical implementation where the sorting logic is hardcoded within the function.

2. The `iocSort` function implements IoC by accepting a comparison function as an argument. This inverts the control of how sorting is performed from the `iocSort` function to the caller.

3. We then use the `IoCSort` function to perform various types of sorting:

   - Ascending and descending sorts on an array of numbers

   - Sorting an array of objects by different properties

By using **IoC**, we've created a more flexible and reusable sorting function.
The `iocSort` function doesn't need to know the specifics of how to compare elements; it just needs to know that it will receive a function that can perform the comparison.

This approach allows for better flexibility and extensibility.
We can now sort any type of data using any comparison logic without modifying the `IOCSort` function itself.

The `iocSort` function doesn't care how the logic works if we sort by ASC or DESC, it is up to the user to call the `iocSort`.

This is the essence of Inversion of Control - control over how sorting is done has been inverted from the sorting function to the caller of the function.

We got a more re-usable function and a more decoupled code by not only depending on how we sort the list in a specific order.
One other benefit is that the code gets easier to test, where we can pass in different sort functions and expect different behaviors.

### Dependency injection using React

Let's say we have a simple React component that increments a counter. The button that gets fired to increment the count should also log what is going on.

```tsx
function logger(count: number) {
  console.log(count);
}

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{count}</h1>

      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count + 1);

          logger(count);
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>

      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count - 1);

          logger(count);
        }}
      >
        Decrement
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Here we will log every time we increment or decrement the country to the console and it works as expected.

But let's say we want some different behavior for the log function where we perhaps want to have some more complex logging when we are in production and the `Counter` component is an erasable component.

The problem right now is that the `Counter` component has a dependency on the `logger` function.

To take the advantage of dependency injection here we can simply pass the `logger` function as a props and then pass in whatever logging function we need.

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Counter
        logger={(count: number) => {
          console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
        }}
      />

      <Counter
        logger={(count: number) => {
          console.log(`Some other message : ${count}`);
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}

function Counter({logger}: {logger: (count: number) => void}) {
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count + 1);
          logger(count);
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>

      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count - 1);
          logger(count);
        }}
      >
        Decrement
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Now we can pass in, inject different `logger` functions that will print different messages.
Where the first `Count` component will log `Count: ${count}` and the second `Count` component will log `Some other message : ${count}`.
This is just a very simple and basic example just to demonstrate the main purpose of dependency injection and why it is useful.
In a real application, you can have more complex logic and functions that you want to inject into your components.
For example, you can inject services, API calls, etc.

### Benefits

- Improved testability: You can easily mock dependencies for unit tests.

- Flexibility: You can swap implementations without changing the component code.

- Separation of concerns: Components don't need to know how to create their dependencies.

By using dependency injection, you make your React components more modular, easier to test, and more flexible to changes in the future.

### Downsides

- Learning curve: Dependency injection introduces an additional layer of abstraction that can be challenging for developers new to the concept.

- Boilerplate code: Implementing dependency injection often requires additional setup code, which can make the codebase more verbose.

- Runtime errors: Many compile-time errors are pushed to runtime when using dependency injection, which can make debugging more difficult.

- Performance overhead: Dependency injection frameworks often use reflection or dynamic programming, which can introduce a slight performance overhead.

### Summary

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and programming technique used in software development to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes, functions and their dependencies.
The main idea behind DI is to make a class independent of its dependencies by separating the usage of an object from its creation.

- Decoupling: DI helps in reducing the coupling between functions and classes, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

- Testability: It improves testability by allowing dependencies to be easily mocked or stubbed in unit tests.

- Flexibility: DI makes it easier to switch between different implementations of a dependency without changing the dependent function or class.

By employing dependency injection, developers can create more flexible, scalable, and testable applications. We make our code more decoupled and bring benefits like refactoring in the future and extending logic.
