In this post, I'll discuss the behavior of maps in Go when passed as arguments into functions.

In Go, when we pass an argument to a function, it can be passed either by value or by reference.
Let's illustrate this through an example:

```go showLineNumbers title="main.go"
func main() {
    var score int = 10
    fmt.Println(score) // 10
    incrementScore(score)
    fmt.Println(score) // 10
}

func incrementScore(score int) {
    score++
}
```

In this example, we pass the `score` into the `incrementScore()` function, but the printed value remains 10.
This is because arguments are passed by value in Go.
To modify the original value, we can pass the score as a reference by changing the function to accept a pointer to an `int` variable:

```go showLineNumbers title="main.go"
func main() {
    var score int = 10
    fmt.Println(score) // 10
    incrementScore(&score)
    fmt.Println(score) // 11
}

func incrementScore(score *int) {
    *score++
}
```

Now, the `score` variable has been successfully mutated, and its value is 11.
We use a pointer to modify the value of a variable from the `incrementScore()` function.

Now, let's shift our focus to maps in Go.
Maps are reference types, meaning that when we pass a map to a function, we pass a reference to the underlying data structure, not a copy of the map.
Although maps themselves are not mutable, the data they reference is mutable:

```go showLineNumbers title="main.go"
func main() {
    score := map[string]int{
        "Tony":  30,
        "Steve": 10,
        "Thor":  2,
    }
    fmt.Println(score) // map[Steve:10 Thor:2 Tony:30]
    changeScores(score)
    fmt.Println(score) // map[Steve:10 Thor:2 Tony:1000]
}

func changeScores(scores map[string]int) {
    scores["Tony"] = 1000
}
```

In this example, modifications made to the map inside the `changeScores()` function are reflected in the original map outside the function.
To avoid modifying the original map, we can create a copy of the map inside the function:

```go showLineNumbers title="main.go"
func main() {
    score := map[string]int{
        "Tony":  30,
        "Steve": 10,
        "Thor":  2,
    }
    fmt.Println(score)
    changedScore := changeScores(score)
    fmt.Println(changedScore)
}

func changeScores(scores map[string]int) map[string]int {
    newScores := make(map[string]int)
    for key, value := range scores {
        newScores[key] = value
    }
    newScores["Tony"] = 1000
    return newScores
}
```

To summarize:

- Maps in Go are reference types.
- Passing a map to a function passes a reference to the underlying data structure.
- Modifications to the map inside a function affect the original map outside the function.
- The map itself is immutable.
- To avoid modifying the original map, create a copy of the map before making changes inside a function.
