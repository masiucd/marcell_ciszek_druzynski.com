Debounce is an valuable technique for optimising code in our programs.
By employing debounce, we can ensure that our code is triggered in a controlled manner.

Consider a search field where the user can enter a search term.
Instead of displaying the results after each keystroke, we want to wait until the user has finished typing.
This approach is crucial to address potential performance issues that may arise.

Just imagine the impact on performance if we were to execute a database query for every single keystroke, including new letters, spaces, and backspaces. To mitigate this problem, we can leverage debounce to significantly improve the situation.

Using debounce, we delay the execution of the database query until the user has completed typing, allowing us to optimise the process effectively.

Just to get a better overview I like to add some metaphors that how debounce works.

- **Debounce as a traffic controller**: Imagine the debounce function as a traffic controller at a busy intersection.
  It intelligently manages the flow of cars, ensuring that only one car passes through at a time.
  Similarly, debounce regulates the execution of code, allowing it to trigger only once within a specified timeframe, preventing an overwhelming influx of requests.
- **Debounce as a Sniper's Perfect Shot:** Imagine debounce as a skilled sniper taking a perfectly timed shot.
  The sniper waits patiently, tracking the target's movements, and carefully takes aim, ensuring the perfect moment to fire.
  Similarly, debounce waits for the opportune time, ensuring that the code execution is triggered precisely when necessary, optimising performance and accuracy.

Adding metaphors makes it simpler to visualise but it is just how I think.

Let's go over some examples where we use debounce to optimise our code.

```js
searchNormal.addEventListener("input", search);
searchDebounce.addEventListener("input", debounce(search, 400));

function search(e) {
	const value = e.target.value.trim().toLowerCase();
	const foundItems = randomItems.filter((item) =>
		item.toLowerCase().includes(value)
	);
	if (value && foundItems.length > 0) {
		result.innerHTML = foundItems
			.map((item) => `<li class="item">${item}</li>`)
			.join("");
	} else {
		result.innerHTML = `<li class="item">No results found</li>`;
	}
}

// Debounce
function debounce(cb, time = 100) {
	let timeout;
	return (...args) => {
		clearTimeout(timeout);
		timeout = setTimeout(() => {
			cb(...args);
		}, time);
	};
}
```

Let go through this example.
The `debounce` function in this code helps to solve a similar problem.
It ensures that a certain action (in this case, calling the `search` function) is not triggered immediately and excessively, but only after a certain period of inactivity.

Here's a breakdown of how the `debounce` function works:

1. It takes two parameters: a callback function (`cb`) and a time value (defaulted to 100 milliseconds).
2. Inside the function, a variable named `timeout` is declared but not assigned a value yet.
3. The `debounce` function returns another function. Think of it as a "wrapper" function that adds some behavior to the original callback function.
4. When the returned function is called (e.g., in the line `searchDebounce.addEventListener("input", debounce(search, 400));`), it performs the following steps:
   - It clears any existing timeout that might have been set previously using `clearTimeout(timeout)`. This is like telling your friend to wait a bit longer before bombarding you with more questions.
   - It sets a new timeout using `setTimeout`. This timeout will wait for the specified time (in this case, 400 milliseconds) before executing the callback function (`cb`).
   - The callback function (`cb`) is called within the timeout. This is like finally allowing your friend to ask you a question after they have waited patiently for a certain period of time.

By using the `debounce` function in this code, the `search` function is wrapped in a way that it won't be called immediately every time the `input` event occurs. Instead, it will be called only after a certain delay (400 milliseconds in this case) of no further input events.
This helps to prevent excessive and unnecessary calls to the `search` function, optimizing the performance of the search feature.

Debounce allows us to delay the execution of the database query until the user has finished typing.
Instead of immediately sending a request for every keystroke, we wait for a short period of inactivity.
This way, if the user continues typing, we reset the timer and wait again.
Only when the user pauses for a moment, the query is finally executed.

By using debounce, we improve the performance of our code and prevent unnecessary database calls.
It's like having a smart system that waits patiently for the user to finish typing before performing the heavy lifting, ensuring a smoother and more efficient experience
