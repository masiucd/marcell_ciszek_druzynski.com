### Why shouldn't we use fixed width and height for elements with text content?

Using fixed width and height on button elements in HTML and CSS can have some drawbacks, especially if they are applied without considering responsive design principles. Here's why it's generally considered bad practice:

1. **Lack of Adaptability:** Fixed dimensions make buttons less adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
   When you use a fixed width and height, buttons may not scale properly on smaller screens or on various devices, like mobile phones and tablets, potentially leading to a poor user experience.

2. **Limited Content Flexibility:** Fixed dimensions can limit the amount of content that can be displayed within a button.
   If the content exceeds the specified dimensions, it might get cut off or overlap with other elements, making it difficult to read or interact with.

3. **Accessibility Concerns:** Fixed-sized buttons can create accessibility issues for users with disabilities.
   Some users may rely on larger text or custom styling for better readability, and fixed dimensions can prevent them from easily adjusting the button size according to their preferences.

4. **Inconsistency:** Different devices and browsers have varying screen sizes and resolutions.
   Fixed-sized buttons may look inconsistent and less appealing across a range of devices and screen sizes.

Instead of using fixed dimensions for buttons, consider using relative units like percentages or using CSS properties such as `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height` to provide flexibility while maintaining a clean and visually pleasing design.
This approach allows buttons to adapt to different screens and content while providing a consistent and user-friendly experience.

Another approach is to manage the size of the elements using <br/>
`padding` and `line-height`. Where `padding` is used to manage the space between the content and the border of the element and `line-height` is used to manage the space between the lines of text content.

For example styling a button element using `line-height` and `paddng`:

```css showLineNumbers title="app.css"
button {
	line-height: 1.125;
	padding: 8px;
	...rest of the styles;
}
```

### Code demo

<CodePen name="Fixed" href="https://codepen.io/legionista1994/pen/dyaoVJW" />
Here in this demo we can see that the first button is using fixed width and height
and the second button is using `line-height` and `padding` to manage the size of
the button. The first button text content is overflowing and the second button is
not.
