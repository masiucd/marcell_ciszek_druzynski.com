JavaScript continues to evolve with exciting new features. While proposals like the [pipe operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) (similar to F#'s elegant function composition) are still in development, I want to highlight a powerful feature that's already available: [`Promise.allSettled()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled).

When working with multiple promises, developers often reach for `Promise.all()`. However, this method takes an "all or nothing" approach. Let's understand why this might not always be ideal.

### Understanding Promise.all()

`Promise.all()` works as follows:

- Takes an array of promises and returns a new promise
- Resolves only when ALL promises resolve successfully
- Rejects immediately if ANY promise rejects
- Returns an array of resolved values in the same order as input promises

Here's a practical example:

```js
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = Promise.resolve(42);
const promise3 = Promise.reject("error");

// All promises succeed
Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then((values) => console.log(values)) // [3, 42]
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));

// One promise fails
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((values) => console.log(values))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error)); // 'error'
```

### Promise.allSettled()

While `Promise.all()` is useful for scenarios where you need all promises to succeed, `Promise.allSettled()` takes a more forgiving approach.
It waits for all promises to complete, regardless of whether they succeed or fail. This makes it particularly valuable when you need to:

- Track the outcome of multiple independent operations
- Handle partial successes gracefully
- Collect both successful and failed results

Here's how `Promise.allSettled()` works:

```js
const promises = [
  Promise.resolve("success"),
  Promise.reject("failure"),
  Promise.resolve("another success"),
];

Promise.allSettled(promises).then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
  /* Output:
    [
      { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'success' },
      { status: 'rejected', reason: 'failure' },
      { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'another success' }
    ]
    */
});
```

The key difference is in the result format. Each promise outcome is represented by an object containing:

- A `status` field: either 'fulfilled' or 'rejected'
- A `value` field for successful promises
- A `reason` field for rejected promises

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a practical scenario where `Promise.allSettled()` shines, calling some user data APIs:

```js
async function fetchUserData(userIds) {
  const userPromises = userIds.map((id) =>
    fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .catch((error) => error),
  );

  const results = await Promise.allSettled(userPromises);

  const successfulFetches = results
    .filter((result) => result.status === "fulfilled")
    .map((result) => result.value);

  const failedFetches = results
    .filter((result) => result.status === "rejected")
    .map((result) => result.reason);

  return {
    successful: successfulFetches,
    failed: failedFetches,
  };
}
```

In this example, even if some API calls fail, we can still:

- Process the successfully fetched user data
- Log or handle the failed requests separately
- Provide meaningful feedback about partial successes

### Browser Support

`Promise.allSettled()` is well-supported in modern browsers and can be polyfilled for older environments. It's part of **ES2020** and is available in:

- Chrome 76+
- Firefox 71+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 79+
- Node.js 12.9.0+

But all depends when you are reading this blog post, so make sure to check the latest compatibility tables on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled#browser_compatibility).
Perhaps it is already available in all major browsers!

### When to Use What

- Use `Promise.all()` when:

  - You need all operations to succeed
  - A single failure should stop the entire process
  - You're dealing with dependent operations

- Use `Promise.allSettled()` when:
  - You want to handle partial successes
  - Operations are independent of each other
  - You need detailed feedback about each promise's outcome

### Summery

Use `Promise.allSettled()` when you need to handle multiple promises independently and want to track their outcomes, whether they succeed or fail.
It's a powerful tool that provides more flexibility than `Promise.all()` in scenarios where partial successes are acceptable.
