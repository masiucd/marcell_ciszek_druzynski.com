# Singleton pattern

The singleton pattern is categorized under _creational_ design patterns. This pattern restricts the instantiation of specific classes, ensuring that only one unique instance of the object can exist. Essentially, it functions as a global variable accessible from any part of the program.

Consider a scenario with a dog as a _Singleton_. When we refer to this _Singleton_, we are consistently pointing to the same instance. Any changes made, such as incrementing the dog's age in one module, will reflect universally across all instances where the dog _Singleton_ is employed.

```ts
let instance: Dog;
class Dog {
	private name: string;
	private age: number;

	constructor() {
		if (instance) {
			throw new TypeError("Cannot create multiple instances");
		}
		this.name = "Bobby";
		this.age = 1;
		instance = this;
	}

	getName(): string {
		return this.name;
	}
	getAge(): number {
		return this.age;
	}
	birthday() {
		this.age += 1;
	}
}
export default new Dog();
```

This singleton dog can be globally shared across multiple modules. When modules import the singleton object, they all reference the same instance. A single method, `birthday()`, is responsible for modifying the age property. Each time any module invokes the `birthday()` method, the age increases by one, and this change becomes visible throughout all modules utilizing the singleton.

It's important to note that creating a singleton doesn't necessarily require the use of `es6 class` syntax; a simple object literal suffices and works equally well.

```ts
let age = 1;
const name = "Bobby";

const dog = {
	getAge: () => age,
	getName: () => name,
	birthday: () => (age += 1),
};

export default dog;
```

The concept of a singleton is frequently employed in our applications, often unintentionally. When an object literal is exported from one module, it essentially becomes a singleton. If another module imports this object and makes modifications to its properties, these changes will have a widespread impact throughout the entire program.

```ts
export const person = {
	name: "Mike",
	age: 22,
};
```

To safeguard against unintentional property mutations, consider using `Object.freeze`:

```ts
const person = {
	name: "Mike",
	age: 22,
};
export default Object.freeze(person);
```

### Common Use Cases

Why opt for a single instance of an object?

The primary rationale is to regulate access to a shared resource, such as a database or file, to avoid potential issues. Having multiple instances connected to a database, for instance, could lead to chaos. Instead, employing a _singleton_ ensures only one instance exists within our database.

```ts
let instance: DbConnection;

class DbConnection {
	private uri: string;
	private isConnected: boolean;

	constructor(uri: string) {
		if (instance) {
			throw new Error("Instance already exists");
		}
		this.uri = uri;
		this.isConnected = false;
		instance = this;
	}

	connect() {
		this.isConnected = true;
		console.log(`DB Connection to ${this.uri}`);
	}

	disconnect() {
		this.isConnected = false;
		console.log(`DB Disconnected from ${this.uri}`);
	}

	getUri(): string {
		return this.uri;
	}

	getIsConnected(): boolean {
		return this.isConnected;
	}
}

export default Object.freeze(
	new DbConnection("postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres")
);
```

This ensures a single, controlled instance of the `DbConnection` class with a designated URI for our PostgreSQL database.

### Singletons in the Real World

Consider the analogy of a person having only one father. It's an inherent singleton scenario; an individual can't have multiple fathers. From this perspective, a father is essentially a singleton.

| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single Instance, Memory Efficiency | Solves Multiple Concerns, Potentially Violates _Single Responsibility Principle_ |
| Global Accessibility               | Increased Coupling, Components Know Too Much About Each Other                    |

### Summary

- **Memory Efficiency**: Singleton patterns contribute to memory optimization by allowing only one instance. This means memory is allocated once and persists throughout the entire program, preventing unnecessary duplication.

- **Default Singletons (Modules)**: Since _ES2015_, modules inherently function as singletons. There's often no need to explicitly create singletons, as the language incorporates this feature.

- **Exercise Caution in Value Modification**: Altering a value in a singleton can have widespread consequences. Changes propagate across all program modules using the singleton, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

- **Testing Challenges**: Singleton patterns can pose challenges in testing. With only one allowed instance, state changes in the singleton may impact tests, leading to failures.

- **Global Variable Analogy**: Singletons are akin to global variables, accessible throughout the entire program. Care must be exercised to avoid unintended overwrites of values, as such changes can have a broad impact on the entire program.
