## Backlog list

I finally decided to start rewrite my blog using next js 13 and the app directory with nested layouts and all new cool features.
I want to make my sight more accessible and more SEO friendly. I also want to make it more modular and easier to maintain. A more clean layout and architecture is also on my list.
Make it easy to maintain and add new features.
